# About

Hi, I'm Tony. 

Why yet another boring technical blog?

Over the years I found that when a problem came up, I would figure out
how to solve it, and then promptly forget what I did. This became
quite annoying in 2017 so I decided to start this blog as a way to
capture things that I learned over time. I just need to keep reminding
myself to write up the bits and bobs that I learn along the way.

I've also written some thoughts on my experiences much further back in
my career, in the hope that some of them may be vaguely interesting,
or even mildly entertaining.

## Programming

I have been programming on various systems since 1981. I started back
then using VAX-BASIC and Z80 assembly language. I have written code
since then in a variety of languages.

I once wrote an oil rig data aquisition system in
TurboBASIC. TurboBASIC allowed event-driven programming (long before
Node) through the use of `ON KEY k GOSUB s` and `ON TIMER t GOSUB s`
constructs, without any assembly language. It's still one of the most
productive languages/environments I have ever used. How things have
changed!

I have been programming in C, on and off, since around 1987, when I
learnt with a copy of Turbo C v2.0 and the Peter Norton's Guide to the
PC. That was pretty much everything you needed to know back then. I
most recently wrote a couple of experimental memory allocators in C
after a roughly ten year hiatus from the language.

I have been using Python on the side for around 3 years, mostly for
web scraping, HTML processing, and spreadsheet manipulation.

I have been an avid Emacs user for some time. I first started using it
when I worked on MySQL Connectors documentation. I had to write
example code in various languages and also DocBook XML and found Emacs
could handle it all very easily. What my desktop typically looks like:

About March 2018 I started using VSCode for a large project I was
involved in for work and have found it very good. I now use a mix of
VSCode and Emacs. In Nov 2018 I started using Projectile in Emacs. So
far so good.

## Current employment

I'm a technical writer at [Nexmo](https://developer.nexmo.com/team),
specializing in writing docs for software developers. Nexmo has an
amazing API and tools for interfacing with the Vonage network.

## Past employment

As a contract technical writer I've worked for ARM, Fotango, The Open
University, Alfresco Software, and Cambridge Silicon Radio (now
Qualcomm).

I've been a permanent technical writer for companies such as
Criterion Software (now EA), Tao Group, Oracle(MySQL), Sun
Microsystems(MySQL), and Alfresco Software.

I also have extensive experience as a technical trainer. Over the
years I've delivered courses on operating systems and Java technology
at Sony (HQ Tokyo), Motorola (Schaumberg, Chicago and Austin, Texas),
Sun Microsystems (Culver City), NTT DoCoMo (San Jose), Sharp Labs
(Portland), and even Amiga (yes, _that_ Amiga). 

I also designed and delivered a course on Embedded C for Nokia
(Camberley, UK), back when Nokia were numero uno.

I feel I've been really lucky to have a varied and interesting
career. One of the highlights was working for Tao Group, with a couple
of breaks, for nearly ten years. We built a complete operating system
from scratch, with all the tools, documentation and training. Our
market was embedded devices and particularly "smart phones" - this was
back before either iOS and Android, in fact, before smartphones! It
was very difficult to convince manufacturers that the smartphone was
the future - then the iPhone happened and the world was changed
forever.

## Other interests

My non-technical interests include walking, scuba, travel, photgraphy,
and travel writing.
