# Cheap radio telemetry with Nexmo and Python

Summary: This article looks at how to set up a cheap radio telemetry
system using something like a Raspberry Pi with an SMS module, Nexmo
and a little bit of Python on the back end.

I crawled further down the cable duct and got an attack of
claustrophobia. It was in the depths of a Norwegian winter and despite
the heat being generated by the TransOcean 8's vast diesel room I was
half frozen. I crawled a bit further, dragging the armoured cable
behind me. Only a few more metres to go and I'd drop, literally, into
the pit room where I'd already installed my junction box. TO8's pit
room was the biggest I'd seen, with twelve main pits. Most rigs I'd
been on only had three. TO8 was the mother of all wildcat rigs,
ploughing its trade in godforsaken stretches of the North Sea. Despite
the dark storm raging outside the TO8 was rock steady, a testament to
is immovable bulk, kept in position by state-of-the-art GPS and huge
computer-controlled thrusters. I lugged the cable a bit
further. Nearly there. I dropped down into the pit room, exhausted,
and pondered how much easier my life would be if I didn't have to lug
cables around. So far, I reckoned I'd wired up 50 sensors, and I was
probably half-done. The most dangerous to install had been the kelly
height sensor. I'd been winched up into the derrick by a roughneck
who'd just worked 12 hours straight. At one point I think he fell
asleep standing up, leaving me dangling in mid air. I quickly
tie-wrapped the kelly bottle onto the kelly block, a makeshift sensor
as simple as it was ingenious - a pressurized system of water and
air - you went up - more water pressure on a strain gauge, you went
down, less pressure. I shouted down to the roughneck and slowly
descended. We both shuffled off the drill deck, thinking of sleep.

The most claustrophic install had been the rotary table RPM
sensor. I'd had to squueze into a tiny crawl space under the rotary
table, the spinning clutch powered by a vast electric motor, that
turned the entire drill string, a couple of miles of the stuff,
probing down into the prehistoric rock formations.

I dropped down into an empty pit and grumbling to myself started
welding in a bracket for the mud level sensor, and wished the whole
mess of cables, the bane of my life, would just go away...

## So what is radio telemetry?

The above little vignette hints at a problem. When you have a biggish
data acquisition project you usually have to end up installing
literally miles of cable, which is a right Royal pain in the bum. A
better way is to use radio telemetry. In the age of the Internet of
Things this should be quite possible, and it is, within certain
limitations.

Radio telemetry is the ability to send data, especially data from
sensors and actuators, via radio waves rather than through electrical
cables.

Radio telemetry is especially useful in scenarios where the source at
edge-of-network is physically very remote, or possibly even
moving. Obviously when you try to run cables from the GPS sensor on a
train and wire it back to your logging unit you are in for some
trouble! ;) Telemetry by radio waves is more or less essential in that
case. You could simply store the data locally for downloading later,
but this does not give you the real-time data you need in many
scenarios. By real-time here we are not talking high frequency
updates - we might only need to know the position of the train every
30 seconds or so.

## Example scenarios

So, just to recap, radio telemetry is very useful where the source of
the data is:

1. Remote
2. Moving

Some examples:

- Geolocation of vehicle
- Weight of load e.g. refuse collection lorry 
- Remote pumping station
- River level monitoring / flood warning
- Weather station
- Alarms of all kinds
- Periodic status updates

In this article I am specifically looking at sending small amounts of
low frequency telemetry data via SMS, using the Nexmo SMS API and a
little bit of Python.

## Overview

So what are we looking at specifically in this article?

With low cost boards available you have the potential for very cheap
sensor electronics. A Raspberry Pi or Arduino are suitable
for low cost multi-channel data acquisition from a variety of
sensors. They are also capable of carrying out various control tasks
such as temperature control and motor control.

Witn suppliers like [Ada Fruit](https://www.adafruit.com) providing
cheap SMS modules for Pi and 'shields' for Arduino - the sky is, quite
literally, the limit. You could acquire data on multiple channels and
then send that information via SMS - it does not matter how remote the
sensor is (as long as there's mobile coverage), or whether the sensor
is moving or not.

By way of example, messages might be sent as follows:

1. TANK1=25.1M, TANK2=13.2M, TANK3=43.9M(ALARM), TANK4=9.7M
2. (21.62514414481643, -2.3010920480245426)=233.7Kg
3. DANGER: Warp drive is overheating! Please call +44-000000000 immediately!

Note, you can identify the source of the data by the incoming message
phone number, so you don't need to include that in the message unless
more than one unit are sharing an "SMS hub". Actually in many
scenarios the idea of an SMS hub could be quite useful.


## Limitations

When using SMS as a radio telemetry system, there are some limitations
to take into account:

1. The rate at which you can send SMS messages. (Nexmo throttles to
   around 30 API calls a second)
2. The message length of a single SMS. (Theoretically there is a
   standard but different carriers have different restrictions)

For small data applications these retrictions will be fine. If you
have especially large chunks of data that data can be spread over
multiple messages. I would not go over three messages though because
not all carriers deliver as many as six.


## Legal

I'm not sure you could use your typical unlimited SMS plan in such a
scenario. You would have to contact your provider. If you are sending
a lot of SMS messages your provider might kick up about it. Still one
SMS an hour for 24 SMS per day is not going to be too problematic - my
daughter used to send several hundred SMS a day when she was about 15!
If in doubt check with your provider and possibly a lawyer!


## Getting set up

1. Install Ngrok. If you plan to run the test code locally you can use
Ngrok. See my [article on
Ngrok](https://coffeeandcode.neocities.org/intro-to-ngrok.html) for
some pointers on how to do this.
2. You'll need to sign up for a Nexmo account. You'll get a couple of
Euros free credit which will let you run a few tests. Renting a
virtual number costs around 1.5 Euros a month. There are then small
costs per outbound call or SMS, but in the example shown here you'll
be testing by sending an inbound SMS with your data in it.
3. Purchase a Nexmo Number (Long Virtual Number). This is the number you'll 
send your telemetry SMS to.
4. Configure a webhook. See the following screenshot:

![Webhook](./images/sms-webhook.png "Configuring a webhook")

You now need to write some code!

## Python backend

Here's the Python code for reacting to an inbound SMS, which contains
your telemetry data:

``` python
# Python 3
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from urllib.parse import urlparse
from urllib.parse import parse_qs
from pprint import pprint

import time
import json

hostName = "localhost"
hostPort = 9000

OK = 200

class MyServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    
    def do_GET(self):

        self.send_response(OK)
        self.send_header("Content-type", "text/html")
        self.end_headers()

        if self.path.startswith('/webhooks/inbound-sms'):
        
            result = urlparse(self.path)
            params = parse_qs(result.query)
            data = params['text'][0]

            print ("Telemetry data is: %s" % data)

            
# Run server
myServer = HTTPServer((hostName, hostPort), MyServer)
print(time.asctime(), "Server Starts - %s:%s" % (hostName, hostPort))
        
try:
    myServer.serve_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
    
myServer.server_close()
print(time.asctime(), "Server Stops - %s:%s" % (hostName, hostPort))
```


## Testing the backend
  
Send a text into your Nexmo Number. You'll see tracing like the
following (I've redacted my phone number and Nexmo number):

``` 
Sat Apr 28 08:16:40 2018 Server Starts - localhost:9000
127.0.0.1 - - [28/Apr/2018 08:18:28] "GET /webhooks/inbound-sms?msisdn=4400000000&to=4400000000&messageId=0B000000D29DB198&text=Telemetry+data+123456789&type=text&keyword=TELEMETRY&message-timestamp=2018-04-28+07%3A18%3A34 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
Telemetry data is: Telemetry data 123456789
```

Just to make it a bit easier to read the webhook response parameters
(with phone numbers redacted) are in the following format:

```
{
    'keyword': ['TELEMETRY'],
    'message-timestamp': ['2018-04-16 11:19:22'],
    'messageId': ['0C000000A7438C74'],
    'msisdn': ['440000000000'],
    'text': ['Telemetry+data+123456789'],
    'to': ['4400000001'],
    'type': ['text']
}
```

The code grabs the data. Of course you can do anything you want wirth
this data including, resending it, processing it, storing it to a file
and so on. Note also ther MSISDN is the phone number of the sending
device, so you have immediate identification of source. Of course if
there are multiple channels on one source the message does still need
to identify the channel, for example `CH1=23.1, CH2=46.5, CH3=1.2`.


## It could be a two-way thing

With Nexmo you can have inbound and outbound phone calls and text
messages. So, you culd for example send a control SMS to your
monitoring or control equipment. You could do things like switch on
your lights at home, activate sprinklers, or switch off a pump that's
overheating. The applications are endless.

## Closing words

I have just scratched the surface here of what is an area with
enormous potential. I hope you've found this useful. You have at least
seen that you can write some Python code to receive data sent in via
SMS, and with that the sky is the limit.
