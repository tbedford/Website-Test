Interesting presentation. Interesting that U+21B4 requires three bytes
if encoded in UTF-8 and only two bytes with UTF-16 - which explains
why UTF-16 is commonly used for non-latin (e.g. Japanese) character
encoding - it's a lot more efficient at encoding those non-latin
characters. I think what they are doing with
[CopperSpice](http://www.copperspice.com/index.html) is also
interesting. It's amazing the state (i.e. mess) of many legacy
libraries when it comes to encodings. Also have a [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/copperspice). Documentation on
[string
terminology](http://www.copperspice.com/docs/cs_string/overview_terminology.html).

* [Rust and Concurrency by David
  Sullins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIikwmeGVYY)
  
As a programmer it's really important to understand concepts of
Resources, Ownership, Lifetime, Scope - and this is critical in a
concurrent context. One minor point, scope is not necessarily the same
thing as lifetime, at least in C (you can have a static variable in a
function with global lifetime but local scope).

* [Kavya Joshi on Keeping Time in Real

* [You can be a kernel hacker by Julia
  Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IQlpFWTFbM) 
  
Wonderful talk by Julia Evans. She is a "high energy" presenter - you
won't be bored. I really like it when Julia uses /proc to recover a
deleted file. Cool. She is also very, very funny - the piece on how to
submit a kernel patch around 18 minutes in is hilarious. I _loved_
this talk! One of the best presenters I've seen in a while.

Not many presentations start with a poem, but this one does and it's
great. Very good presenter who speaks clearly and at the right
pace. Very useful presentation on managing systems.
