**Website News**

**[2018-05-04]**

I was pleased to see I managed to exceed my target quota of articles
for last month, despite being incredibly busy with my new job. I
expect to perhaps do as many as five articles this month, but we will
see.

Sometime early this morning I wrote the very first lines of what will
be the new website. I think this news probably warrants an article in
its own right. I can reveal a few things. It will be a Flask web
app. It will use Markdown as the source file format, and it will most
likely be hosted on Heroku. There will be new features such as tags,
comments, and a better design. Actually the core design - a pipeline
of processing stages on the Markdown and HTML source will stay. Those
Bash shell scripts really have to go though!

The other shocking news is I've been edging away from using
Emacs/Magit and have been using Visual Studio Code a lot more. It has
proved suprisingly wonderful to use. Surely that deserves an article!
Still, Emacs will still be my go to editor for the smaller tasks and
when I log into my test servers.

The stats for the site continue to climb ever upward. Thank you for
your support, and I'm glad some of you find my ramblings of some
interest.

Well after just short of a month in the Philippines I am back. It was
a great holiday although we did get hit by typhoon Basyang. The
typhoon season is supposed to end in November, so we hadn't been
expecting that! It is also something of a shock to come back from 30C
to colder climes - it was MINUS 7C out there this morning! Watch out
for new articles AND new photos (check Updates below for details)!

Happy New Year! It's been a little quiet here as I have been working
through some Udemy courses. I have also been prepping for my upcoming
Philippines trip. I really am excited to be attending PyCon
Philippines this year. However, I do expect things to pick up on my
return, starting with a review of some of the courses I have been
doing and also a review of the PyCon Philippines event. I also have
some exciting new projects in mind! Stay tuned!
