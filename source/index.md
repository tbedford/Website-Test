Well after just short of a month in the Philippines I am back. It was
a great holiday although we did get hit by typhoon Basyang. The
typhoon season is supposed to end in November, so we hadn't been
expecting that! It is also something of a shock to come back from 30C
to colder climes - it was MINUS 7C out there this morning! Watch out
for new articles AND new photos (check Updates below for details)!

Happy New Year! It's been a little quiet here as I have been working
through some Udemy courses. I have also been prepping for my upcoming
Philippines trip. I really am excited to be attending PyCon
Philippines this year. However, I do expect things to pick up on my
return, starting with a review of some of the courses I have been
doing and also a review of the PyCon Philippines event. I also have
some exciting new projects in mind! Stay tuned!
